now make a shortened brief updating the code i have already made with the following needs.
when the program is runned and it asks the user to register or login, it must give the offer of using you google/gmail account and the little popup may come up asking which google account you want to use. add the whole system of logins meaning a place somewhere underneath the user box and/or passwrod box saying forgot password? and then the program should send a recovery email to the users email they aready have an account saved as where they simly click a button to confrim tit is them. and have a siilar system in the app to change theit password. when in the app, the user can create bins but in the main menus/dashboard i want it to look like the  google calendar website/app so the user can see their bins more clearer and when the click on a day they can add a bin and edit at will in the future the exact same as google calendar can. also in bin types, it is better to have the types like medical waste, batteries, textiles, and so on, only accessible for when you switch to the commercial bin customization the same way how you can only access a certain amount of colors in the commercial customization based on what they need in the UK. following that the colors red, and orange need to be added in the commercial creation of bins because in the uk there are big commercial bins that are red and in hospitals, you mainly see orange bins located around the site to indicate medical waste. the user also needs to be able to select multiple days at once per bin because not everyone's schedule is once per week for a bin, it changes continuously. the program should not send notifications of the bin itself to the user's email the code should actually send it as an automated message to the user's phone number (which should be required when creating an account) through SMS. this notification should be sent the day before but the specific time should be able to be created by the user same as an alarm when they are adding/editing a bin. Another big part should be adding the concept of multiple properties if the person has more than one site they need to record. the way I want this to look is exactly how Netflix is when creating profiles after logging into the website. each profile will be named with the address of the place typed in by the user. the address details asked should only be the door number and st name and once the user types them in they can click create (obviously give the user the option to edit the name of it with a little image on a pen next to the name same way netflix does) after creating a profile the user must be sent to the dashboard and given access to the application as usual with all the updated previously stated.

i need an entire brief in detail just for the mulrtiple property update and making profiles like netflix with the user tying in the adress as thenname as the profile being able to be edited as stated previously. i also need to make sure in the breif it specifically tells you to make the program send an SMS notification to the users phone number at the exact time that is stated when the user iputs the time wanted and the system should send an autoated message to remind the user to take out their bin. the user also needs to be able to click more than one day of collection when creating a bin for example if the bin needs to be taken on both the 25th and 26th in the same week they should be able to select more than one date. in the dashboard the bins should be shown in order of which is closest to its collection date, not in the order of creation. in the login phase the user MUST type in a phone number. the user needs to be able to change theit password after being logged in by using the email verification system with the required email asked for in the beggining of the code while registering.
